# FlexFit Fitness App

## Description
The goal of this app was to create a FlexFit Fitness App that had app functionality. The goal was to interact with files, style each page and make it look as professional as possible. We used two APIs to gather information. One was simpler to display a random quote from an author and have their message displayed on the home screen. We made sure to make each page as responsive as possible in the given time. After the home page we made a main landing page for the app to branch out to other pages for expandability. The main page we have working is the exercises page that takes in user input and displays a list of exercises given the parameters.
